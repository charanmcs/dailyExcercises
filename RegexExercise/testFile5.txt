Understanding vowels is the foundation for reading and writing the English language. Try stringing a line of consonants together and ask your child or students to make sense of what they see.  They will soon realize that vowels give meaning to words and create patterns that assist their ability to read correctly.

It is essential for young children to be exposed to the power of vowels from the earliest stages of their reading development.  Research has demonstrated that confusion with vowel sounds, or a lack of knowledge for the importance of vowels in words, serves to create much of the reading problems we see in literacy support classes at school.

For instance it is not uncommon for young children to confuse the vowels “i” and “e”.  One way to overcome this problem is to focus on these vowels independently in the first instance and then to participate in classification activities so students learn to differentiate between the two vowels sound. Following is a sequence of a few simple tasks to teach children to decode words which contain the “i” or “e” vowel sounds.

1)           Make large cut outs of both sounds. Display and discuss the difference in the shape of the letters.

2)           Display word list that contain “i” and “e” as beginning and medial sounds. Colour code vowels to assist young readers with their visual perception of the sound.
